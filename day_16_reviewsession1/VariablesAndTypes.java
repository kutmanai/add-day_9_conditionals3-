		 * -> type /datatype , name, value
		 * Java is a strongly  typed language:
		 * it means before using any variable, we need to declare first:
		 * When you declare , we need to put type and name:
		 * for exp: int steps;
		 * int step://will not let do declare same variable twice
		 * double steps :// not allowed
		 * Variable names - sometimes can be called as Identifiers;
		 * double price;
		 * System.out.println(price);// bot initialized compile error
		 * Initialize means assigning value for the first time.
		 * double price =12.40;
